/**
 * [260] Single Number III
 *
 * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *
 * Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
 * Output: [3,5]
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * <ol>
 * 	The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
 * 	Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
 * </ol>
